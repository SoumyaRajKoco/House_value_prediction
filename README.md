Predict median house values in Californian districts, given a number of features from these districts.


## Dataset description

This dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset available from Luís Torgo's page (University of Porto). Luís Torgo obtained it from the StatLib repository (which is closed now). The dataset may also be downloaded from StatLib mirrors.

This dataset appeared in a 1997 paper titled Sparse Spatial Autoregressions by Pace, R. Kelley and Ronald Barry, published in the Statistics and Probability Letters journal. They built it using the 1990 California census data. It contains one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).
## Steps to create ML project:

Look at the big picture.
Get the data.
Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
Select a model and train it.
Fine-tune your model.
Present your solution.

## Experiments

After model model training, tried to GridSearchCV with RandomizedSearchCV.
Also, tried to add a transformer in the preparation pipeline to select only the most
important attributes and create a single pipeline that does the full data preparation plus the final
prediction.
